# Markdownify

## What is this module?

It's a Drupal 7 module for using the Markdownify project.

## What does it do?

That's a two-part question.

What does Markdownify do?  It's a library for converting HTML to Markdown.

What does this module do?  Um, nothing.  Well that's not strictly true - it's a lightweight module which makes the Markdownify class available to your projects.  It just doesn't 'do' anything in itself.

## What's it for?

Well, I wrote it so I could use Markdownify as part of a module for exporting a Drupal site into Jekyll.  But you could use it whenever you want to convert HTML content to Markdown, I guess.

(Incidentally the Drupal to Jekyll export module - and accompanying blog post - is on its way)

## How do I install it?

In the usual way - bearing in mind it depends on the libraries module - then install the Markdownify library from here:  http://milianw.de/projects/markdownify/ and place it in sites/all/libraries.
